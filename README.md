# botMaker
Some random bot maker I built just because ðŸ˜‚ 

Here's what you need to do to make use of this bot maker:
- Export Telegram chat history with someone. For convenience, you can export it in the form of html files.
- Create a folder in the repository, you can name it whatsoever, but if you don't know what to name it, you can name it "sample_data". Place all of your html files there.
- Edit the config.py accordingly.
- Run the setup.sh -> [chmod +x setup.sh] or [source setup.sh]
- Run the html_parser.py to parse your data into the parse_result.txt
- Run official_bot.py... have fun!
